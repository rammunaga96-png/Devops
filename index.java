Pipeline as Code describes a set of features that allow Jenkins users to define pipelined job processes with code, stored and versioned in a source repository. These features allow Jenkins to discover, manage, and run jobs for multiple source repositories and branches — eliminating the need for manual job creation and management.

To use Pipeline as Code, projects must contain a file named Jenkinsfile in the repository root, which contains a "Pipeline script."

Additionally, one of the enabling jobs needs to be configured in Jenkins:

Multibranch Pipeline: build multiple branches of a single repository automatically

Organization Folders: scan a GitHub Organization or Bitbucket Team to discover an organization’s repositories, automatically creating managed Multibranch Pipeline jobs for them

Pipeline: Regular Pipeline jobs have an option when specifying the pipeline to "Use SCM".

Fundamentally, an organization’s repositories can be viewed as a hierarchy, where each repository may have child elements of branches and pull requests
